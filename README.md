# Status as of 240726

Just starting this up, setting up the structure now

# Structure

- `src` : for my code, source scripts
- `lib` : resources, data, upstream stuff, other people's code I'm importing
- `out` : outputs generated, deletable and should be regenerated
- `tmp` : temporary scratch directory
